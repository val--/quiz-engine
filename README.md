# Quiz Engine (a playground project)

Run `task docker-start` in your terminal to launch the project and `task docker-down` to stop it.

The `./back` folder contains the api (Symfony 6) and the `./front` folder contains the ui (React).

More to come.

If you don't have task, install it: https://taskfile.dev/installation/
